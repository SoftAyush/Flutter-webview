# Flutter web

A Flutter project that serves as a starting point for building a mobile application.

## What This Does

This Flutter project provides a basic template to get started with mobile app development. It includes initial configurations for setting up a mobile app with Flutter. The project focuses on integrating a WebView component that allows you to open a web app on your phone, enabling the web app to access the camera and file system for additional functionality like capturing images and selecting files.

## Features

- **Web App Camera Access**: The web app inside the WebView can request access to the phone's camera for capturing images or video.
- **Web App File Access**: The web app inside the WebView can also request access to the phone's file system, allowing users to upload files or select from their device storage.
